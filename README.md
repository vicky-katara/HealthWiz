A healthcare application can store private healthcare data of user, such as name, address, and
medical history. In general, a user would want to hold such Protected Health Information (PHI),
as this information is termed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA),
private. Therefore, ordinarily, a mobile phone should not share that information.
However, during a medical emergency, a user may wish to share that information with others.
For example, an unconscious user may wish to let it known to bystanders whether he or she
suffers from a condition such as diabetes or epilepsy, and what his or her blood type, blood
pressure, and heart rate are. However, the user cannot be giving instructions when the user is
unconscious. Hence, it is up to the user’s mobile phone to figure out if the user is unconscious

This app, addresses this scenario, and reveals user’s private health data when necessary.

User had a fall. Instead of implementing a realistic fall detection algorithm, just use a
pseudorandom number.
